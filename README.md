## **1. Core Python Concepts**

- **Static/Dynamic Typing & Variable Scope**  
  Understand Python’s dynamic typing and variable scoping rules.

- **Built-in Functions for Introspection**  
  Use `dir()`, `help()`, `isinstance()`, `attr()` for object introspection.

- **Basic Data Types & Structures**  
  Familiarize yourself with fundamental types: `int`, `str`, `bool`, `None`, and collections like `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `dict`.

---

## **2. Advanced Python Libraries & Tools**

- **Itertools & Collections**  
  Work with `itertools` for efficient looping and `collections` for specialized container data types.

- **Pydantic**  
  Utilize Pydantic for data validation and parsing.

- **Comprehension Operations**  
  Master list, set, and dictionary comprehensions for concise and readable code.

---

## **3. Python Design Patterns**

- **Decorators**  
  Create and apply function decorators for reusable and clean code.

- **Generators**  
  Use `yield` to create memory-efficient generators for handling large data streams.

- **Context Managers**  
  Leverage `with` statements by implementing custom context managers for resource management.

- **Exception Handling**  
  Best practices for raising, handling, and organizing exceptions in Python.

---

## **4. Concurrency & Parallelism**

- **AsyncIO**  
  Perform asynchronous programming using `async` and `await`.

- **Multithreading**  
  Understand threading and multiprocessing to execute parallel tasks efficiently.

---

## **5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

- **Data Classes**  
  Simplify class definitions and remove boilerplate using Python’s `dataclass`.

- **Static & Class Methods**  
  Learn the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` and when to use them.

---

## **6. Working with Data**

- **Logging**  
  Set up structured and efficient logging for debugging and monitoring.

- **Pandas & Numpy**  
  Master data manipulation and analysis using `pandas` and perform numerical operations efficiently with `numpy`.

- **JSON Handling**  
  Work with JSON data using Python's `json` library for serialization and deserialization.

- **Databases & Indexing**  
  - **MongoDB (CRUD Operations)** with `pymongo`.  
  - **Elasticsearch (CRUD Operations)** for indexing and searching data.  
  - **SQLAlchemy** for relational database management.  
  - **Redis** for caching and in-memory key-value store.

- **API Interactions**  
  Handle HTTP requests with `aiohttp` (for async) and `requests` libraries.

---

## **7. Testing & Debugging**

- **PyTest**  
  Write and run unit tests with `pytest` to ensure code quality.

- **Python Debugger (PDB)**  
  Debug Python code step-by-step using `pdb`.

---

## **8. Web Development & REST APIs**

- **FastAPI**  
  Build fast and high-performance APIs using FastAPI for serving machine learning models or AI systems.

---

## **9. Authentication & Authorization**

- **Sessions & Tokens**  
  Implement authentication mechanisms like **OAuth**, **SSO**, and **JWT** to handle sessions securely.

---

## **10. GenAI & Large Language Models (LLMs)**

- **Prompt Engineering**  
  Techniques for writing effective prompts for generative AI models (e.g., GPT).

- **Working with OpenAI’s GPT-3/4**  
  Learn how to interact with OpenAI models and fine-tune them for specific tasks.

- **API Calls to LLMs**  
  Make efficient API calls to interact with LLMs and generate responses.

- **Building Applications with LLMs**  
  Implement and deploy applications that utilize LLMs for various AI-powered functionalities.

---

## **11. DevOps & Version Control**

- **Git & GitHub**  
  Version control best practices to manage codebases, branches, and collaboration.

- **Microservices Architecture**  
  Learn how to design and build scalable microservices.

- **Containerization with Docker**  
  Use Docker to containerize applications and dependencies.

- **Container Orchestration with Kubernetes**  
  Manage, deploy, and scale containers using Kubernetes.
